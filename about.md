Hi, I am Jonathan Worthington. I am a full stack developer.  During the day I work as a Software Engineer on business applications.  At night I do contract work and create apps and games on the side. 

I prefer to serve with Php and Ruby based stacks and also love to work 
on [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Processwire CMS/CMF][pw].
