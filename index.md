I am a full stack software engineer that loves all things .net and c#.  At my day job I build and maintain several large WPF and Angular projects.    

Currently I have an avid interest in Azure, Cognitive Services, Chat bots, Facial Recognition, Unity3d, Augmented reality and Xamarin.  I spend much of my spare time playing with these technologies.

I enjoy playing racquetball, road biking, swimming and running.  Because I am a recovering type 2 diabetic I follow a fairly strict diet and am always interested in sharing what I have learned about reversing diabetes.  My health blog can be found at here: <http://www.healthyagainfoundation.com>.

This blog includes all the stuff I either find interesting that is related to programming, or fun stuff i've done on the side, for game jams, conferences or presentations.  I don't blog about my day work because line of business applications are largely boring.
