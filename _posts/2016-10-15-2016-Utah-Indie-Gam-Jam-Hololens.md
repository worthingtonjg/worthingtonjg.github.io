I programmed this for the 2016 Utah Indie Game Jam in 48 hours with a team of 5 developers.  It is an augmented reality experience using the Hololens that allows you to interact with talking characters and fight zombies that transition from the virtual world into our world.

# Details

- We used mixamo to create the 3d models
- Salsa lip sync for the character facial acting
- We used the Hololens toolkit and Unity3d to develop for the hololens

The Hololens allows us to use gaze, gestures, voice and spatial recognition in our application to make it feel like zombies are walking through a dimensional rift into our world.

You must battle the zombies to protect our dimension from the infection in the hidden world.
