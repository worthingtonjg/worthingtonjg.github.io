I participated in the 2016 Global Gam Jam with my two sons and a couple of my friends from work.  The theme of the game jam was "Ritual".  Going into the Game Jam we had decided before hand to make a Descent like clone (or get as far as we could on this in 48 hours).

The game we made is called Relic Hunter.  Below is the intro screen to our game:
