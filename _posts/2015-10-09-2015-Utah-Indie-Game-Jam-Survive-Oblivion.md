My 15 year old son Nathan and I wrote this game in 48 hours for the 2015 Utah Indie Game Jam.  We got voted by our peers 3rd place overall, which was awesome.  We did all the 2d artwork ourselves (you can tell - it's pretty bad), and Nathan did all the modeling for the 3d art work (which is actually pretty good).  The textures we got from the asset store.

## Disclaimer

This code was written in 48 hours for a Game Jam / Hackathon. As such there are some "hacks" and quick fixes that were implemented due to time constraints. Please keep your expectations for code quality low and keep in mind 48 hours is not a lot of time to finish a project. And much of this project was done on very little sleep.
