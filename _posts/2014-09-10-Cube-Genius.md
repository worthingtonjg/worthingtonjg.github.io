I really enjoy solving the Rubiks Cube.  I wrote this application because I thought I could help other people learn to solve the cube.  Me and another developer wrote this for the Windows store using the XNA framework in a couple of weeks. We have over 100,000 downloads, and 4+ star average review.

I am especially happy with the tutorial mode that shows teaches you how to solve the cube.  

XNA is now a thing of the past.  If I had time I'd probably re-write this in Unity.
