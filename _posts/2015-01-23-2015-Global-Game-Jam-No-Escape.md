This was our 2015 Game Jam entry. I developed this game with my 14 year old son in 48 hours using Unity3d.  We wanted a game that tells a story. We had two days to create something, and this is what we came up with.  You are stuck in a prison cell with no escape. You keep passing out and having these visions / out of body experiences that allow you to wander the prison. Are your dreams real?

Doing a project like this in two days was super tough. We had to limit the scope of the project to get it done quickly.

- I enjoyed developing the switch from night to day (out of body) concept. We change the music and lighting so the player can tell they are dreaming.

- I Created a triggered story system that allows you to tell stories based on triggers in the game. Still a bit rough, but allowed us to build the dialog and story faster.

- The ending of the game is creative / unexpected. Makes you think.
