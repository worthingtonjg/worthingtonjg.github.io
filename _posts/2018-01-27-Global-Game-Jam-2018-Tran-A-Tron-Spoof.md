This is our entry in the 2018 Global Game Jam.  The theme of the jam was *Transmission*, so we decided to make a movie inspired entry based on Tron.  We took movie clips directly from both the 1982 version of the movie and the 2010 version of the movie and integrated them into our game to introduce each of our levels.  The effect of the movie clips makes the game seem more polished than it really is.  Also we used some really cool glow effects in all the levels that I feel really added a good look and feel to the game.

## Disclaimer

As always, this code was written in 48 hours and on very little sleep.  So don't expect much quality from the code.

## WebGL Build

Below is a link to the WebGL build.  However not everything works in WebGL, and I haven't taken the time to fix the problems.  The game runs better when built as an .Exe (but for those who want to try it here is a link).
