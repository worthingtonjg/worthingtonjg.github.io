Sudoku is one of those games that I really enjoy.  Back in college I wrote a Sudoku game for one of my classes, and I thought it would be interesting to re-write it for the Windows Store.  This sudoku app has actually done really well for me in the Windows Store with 250,000+ downloads and plenty of ad revenue.
